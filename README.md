# Networking-Concepts

## IP Address

An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. 

To generate IP address, the standard that follow is IPv4. 

IPv4: Represents IP Address in 4 bytes or 32 bits. 

## Subnet

A subnet or subnetwork is a smaller network inside a large network. Subnetting makes network routing much more efficient.

Advantages

1. Security
2. Privacy
3. Isolation

### Private Subnet 

A subnet is some network which doesn't have access to internet.
Its is a practice that private subnets should start with 192, 172, 10 only.

### Public Subnet

A subnet is some network which has access to internet, by pointing a route in its routing table to an Internet Gateway.

### CIDR Range

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet. 

## Ports

A port is a virtual endpoint that allows different applications and services to communicate with each other over a network connection.

Simply, A port is a unique number of your application.
